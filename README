netsfs - Network Stats File System
----------------------------------

This code is only a prototype of a usable file system.

The basic idea came from the demuxfs [1], a live filesystem that aids on the 
analysis of transport streams in digital TV systems. Thanks Lucas V. Real.

The goal of netsfs is collect information about the packets that pass through
the network interface from the time the filesystem is mounted.

	
This data will be shown as a directory structure, where the user can easily 
see statistics packages.


Instalation
-----------

make
insmod netsfs.ko
mkdir /net (or another dir)
mount -t netsfs none /net
